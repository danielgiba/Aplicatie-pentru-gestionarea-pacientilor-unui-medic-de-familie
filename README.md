    -------------------------------- APPLICATION FOR MANAGING PACIENTS --------------------------------------
        NOTE: This project belongs to Giba George-Daniel, 332AA ACS IS - Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer
    Science. 

      In this application, I've implemented an easier patient management system within a database, including their information and needs.
    I've utilized C# for implementation with the ASP.NET framework. To streamline the management of each patient, we utilized SQL to 
    integrate necessary functions into queries. Consequently, we've created files to facilitate easier patient management: I developed a 
    page where users can add a patient to the database and perform other operations such as update and delete on their data. Similarly, 
    I've followed this procedure for appointments, medical specializations, and medications. In plus, to simplify the administration process 
    for the family doctor concerning each patient's needs, we've created pages for medical prescriptions and referrals for their patients.
    
    Features:
    -> Patient Management: allows the admin to add, update, and delete patient records from the database.
    -> Appointment Management: analyze the scheduling and tracking of patient appointments.
    -> Medical Specializations: provides functionality for managing medical specializations within the system.
    -> Medication Management: facilitates the tracking and administration of medications prescribed to patients.
    
    Usage of the app:
    -> Adding a Patient: navigate to the "Add Patient" page, fill in the required information, and submit the form to add a new patient to the database.
    -> Updating Patient Information: access the patient's record and make the necessary changes using the provided interface.
    -> Deleting a Patient: select the patient to be deleted and confirm the action to remove them from the system.
    -> Managing Appointments: utilize the appointment management functionality to schedule and track patient appointments efficiently.
    -> Medical Prescriptions: generate medical prescriptions for patients directly from the application interface.
